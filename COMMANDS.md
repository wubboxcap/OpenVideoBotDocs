# Commands Documentation

## Editing commands:
***
### OVB, Destroy command:  
The `ovb [<arg1>=<val1>,<arg2>=<val2>,...]` commands takes parameters and edits a video according to it    
    
    Example: `ovb bass=100`, add a bass boost of 100.
    
    To use multiple commands, use commas `,` to separate them. For example, `bass=100, hypercam`
    To use multiple groups of commands, use pipes `|` to separate groups of commands. For example, `ytp=100,toptext=BEH BEH|hcycle=3`

### Download command:  
The `download <video>` command takes one parameter `video` as either a search query or URL.
    
    Example: `download chevron commercials`, searches for "download chevron commercials" and downloads it up to 25mb; also supports URLs

### Concat command:  
The `concat <n> [<video1>, <video2>, ...]` command, which can take in `<n>` videos and concatinate them.

    You can type the start of the filename  in order to order them 
    
    Example `concat 2 g h` (say a channel has two recent videos "hello.mp4" and "goodbye.mp4", this concatinates the videos with `goodbye.mp4` coming first)

## Metacommands:

### Pecking order:

When doing an editing command, the order is as followed:

    Attachments > attachments of replied to message > recent messages in channel
    
### Command chaining:
You can link together commands using `>>` between them. For example, `download Chevron Commercial >> destroy speed 5, toptext chevron car lore` would download `Chevron Commercial` and then speed up the video with a caption reading `chevron car lore`
    
By adding `!` at the start of a command, the bot, when replying to itself, will override the previous message by deleting it before sending the result.
    
    Example: !download woman dancing >> !destroy e 30, speed 5, mute, music penis music, musicskip 8 >> download man dancing >> !destroy e 30, speed 5, mute, music dramatic music, musicskip 25, volume 2 >> concat >> cap face off

    Will download two videos, speed up, mute, add a song and caption to them, and then finally concatinate them
